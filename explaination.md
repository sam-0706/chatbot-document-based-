# Explanation of the Streamlit Application Code

This document provides a **step-by-step, detailed explanation** of the Streamlit application for querying a PDF document using **Azure OpenAI** and **Hugging Face embeddings**. The goal is to make this explanation so clear that even a beginner or a fresher engineer can understand it completely.

---

## 1. Importing Libraries

### Code Block:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import streamlit as st

from llama_index.readers.file.docs import PDFReader
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
```

### Explanation:

1. ``** and **``:

   - Used for file handling.
   - `os` allows interaction with the operating system.
   - `Path` from the `pathlib` module simplifies working with file paths.

2. ``:

   - This library creates the user interface (UI) for our app. It provides components like buttons, file uploaders, and text inputs.

3. ``** imports**:

   - `PDFReader`: Reads PDF files and extracts content.
   - `VectorStoreIndex`: Creates an index for efficient querying of documents.
   - `HuggingFaceEmbedding`: Initializes a pre-trained embedding model from Hugging Face.
   - `OpenAI`: Connects to OpenAI’s language model API (configured for Azure in this case).

## 2. Configuring Azure OpenAI Credentials

### Code Block:

```python
import openai
openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_base = "https://hongpt3-openai-eus.openai.azure.com/"
openai.api_version = "2023-07-01-preview"
openai.api_key = "*****************************"  # Replace with your actual Azure OpenAI key
openai.azure_endpoint = "https://hongpt3-openai-eus.openai.azure.com/"  # Optional if required
```

### Explanation:

1. ``:

   - Imports the OpenAI library, which is used to interact with OpenAI’s language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4).

2. **Azure-specific configuration**:

   - `api_type`: Specifies that we’re using Azure OpenAI instead of OpenAI’s standard API.
   - `api_base`: The URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.
   - `api_version`: The API version for Azure OpenAI (in this case, “2023-07-01-preview”).
   - `api_key`: Your Azure OpenAI key for authentication. Replace with your actual key.
   - `azure_endpoint`: Optional additional endpoint for specific Azure integrations.

3. **Purpose**:

   - These settings tell the app where to send requests, which version of the API to use, and how to authenticate.

## 3. Initializing the OpenAI Model

### Code Block:

```python
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

### Explanation:

1. ``** class**:

   - Represents the connection to Azure’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

2. **Parameters**:

   - `model`: Specifies the model to use. In Azure OpenAI, this refers to the deployment name you created (not the raw model name).

3. **Purpose**:

   - This initializes the connection to Azure OpenAI, which will process natural language queries.

---

## 4. Initializing the Embedding Model

### Code Block:

```python
embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

### Explanation:

1. ``:

   - Initializes a pre-trained embedding model from Hugging Face.
   - This model converts text into vector representations, making it easier to index and query.

2. ``:

   - Specifies the Hugging Face model to use. The chosen model (“sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2”) is lightweight and efficient for semantic search tasks.

3. **Purpose**:

   - Generates embeddings (numerical representations) for document text, enabling similarity-based search.

---

## 5. Creating the Streamlit User Interface

### Code Block:

```python
st.title("PDF Document Q&A using Azure OpenAI + Hugging Face Embeddings")
st.write("Upload a PDF document, and ask questions about its content.")

uploaded_pdf = st.file_uploader("Upload your PDF file", type=["pdf"])
```

### Explanation:

1. ``:

   - Displays the app’s title at the top of the page.

2. ``:

   - Adds a brief description below the title.

3. ``:

   - Adds a file upload button for PDFs.
   - The `type=["pdf"]` ensures only PDF files can be uploaded.

---

## 6. Handling PDF Upload and Processing

### Code Block:

```python
if uploaded_pdf is not None:
    temp_pdf_path = Path("temp_document.pdf")
    with open(temp_pdf_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_pdf.read())

    loader = PDFReader()
    documents = loader.load_data(file=temp_pdf_path)

    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, embed_model=embed_model)

    st.session_state["index"] = index
    st.success("Document has been processed and indexed! You can now ask questions.")
```

### Explanation:

1. ``:

   - Ensures this block runs only after a PDF is uploaded.

2. **Saving the uploaded file**:

   - The uploaded file is temporarily saved as `temp_document.pdf` for processing.

3. ``:

   - Reads the uploaded PDF and extracts its content into a usable format.

4. **Creating the Index**:

   - `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents`: Converts the document content into an indexed format using the Hugging Face embedding model.

5. ``:

   - Stores the index in the app’s session state, allowing it to persist across interactions.

6. **Success Message**:

   - Displays a message confirming the document has been processed and is ready for queries.

## 7. Adding the Q&A Section

### Code Block:

```python
if st.session_state["index"] is not None:
    question = st.text_input("Ask a question about your document:")
    if st.button("Get Answer"):
        if question.strip() == "":
            st.warning("Please enter a valid question.")
        else:
            query_engine = st.session_state["index"].as_query_engine(llm=llm)
            response = query_engine.query(question)
            st.write(f"**Answer:** {response}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check if the index exists**:

   - Ensures that users can only ask questions after the document has been processed.

2. ``:

   - Adds a text box for users to input their questions.

3. ``:

   - Adds a button labeled “Get Answer.” Clicking it triggers the query logic.

4. **Validating the Question**:

   - If the user submits an empty question, a warning is shown.

5. **Creating the Query Engine**:

   - The document index is converted into a query engine using the Azure OpenAI LLM.

6. **Querying the Document**:

   - The user’s question is passed to the query engine.
   - The response is displayed on the app.

## Summary

1. **Purpose**:

   - This app allows users to upload a PDF, processes it with Hugging Face embeddings, and enables Q&A using Azure OpenAI.

2. **Key Features**:

   - PDF Upload.
   - Document Indexing.
   - Interactive Question & Answer interface.

3. **Technologies Used**:

   - **Streamlit**: For the user interface.
   - **Azure OpenAI**: For language understanding and responses.
   - **Hugging Face**: For semantic embeddings.
   - **llama\_index**: For document processing and querying.
